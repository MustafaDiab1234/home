                        <h2>What is airbending?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Air bending is one of the four elemental bending arts with the aerokinetic 
                            ability to manipulate and control air. Air is the element of freedom. The Air 
                            Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns; finding peace and freedom to 
                            solve their daily problems in life. Airbenders seek spiritual enlightenment 
                            (self-realization/inner peace) as a result, all children born into the 
                            Air Nomads were Airbenders. The first-ever air benders learned from the <a href =
                            "https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Flying_bison"> Flying Bison</a>. Air benders are constantly moving and are off the ground
                            and bend through one&rsquo;s motion of hands and feet.  
                        </p>
                        <h3>Alternate styles of airbending</h3>

                            <li> Flight (by <a href = "https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Zaheer"> Zaheer</a>) </li>

                        <h2>The Air Nomad Genocide</h2>
                        <p> Before the <a href = "https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Hundred_Year_War">Hundred Year War</a>, 
                            <a href = "https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Sozin">Fire Lord Sozin</a> knew that the next avatar 
                            would be born an Air Nomad, and toke advantage of the <a href = "https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Sozin%27s_Comet">Great Comet</a> (or Sozin&rsquo;s comet during the 100 year war) to wipe out all the 
                            air nomads. Fire Lord Sozin had succeded, however before the genocide, Aang (the avatar) had left 
                            the Air Nation due to the pressure of being the avatar, becoming the last airbender.
