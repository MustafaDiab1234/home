                        <p>
                            Water bending is one of the four elemental bending arts with the hydrokinetic ability to 
                            control water in all of its forms. Water is the element of change, the people of the water 
                            tribe are capable of adapting to situations. They have a deep sense of community and love 
                            that holds them together through anything. Water benders use slow movements and delicate turns and 
                            spin to return the momentum of the opponent&rsquo;s attack with blasts of water.
