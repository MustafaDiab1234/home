                        <p> 
                            Fire Bending is one of the four elemental bending arts with the pyrokinetic ability to produce and control fire. Fire is the 
                            element of power, the people of the Fire Nation have the desire, will, and energy to achieve what they want. Fire bending is 
                            unique from the other elements as it&rsquo;s the only element in which the performer can generate the element. The first fire benders

                        <p> Fire benders draw power from the sun. Fire benders use their internal body heat as the source 
                            of their bending. However, during the<a href = "https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Hundred_Year_War"> 
                            Hundred Year War</a>, a militaristic fire Nation fueled their bending by anger and rage instead
